  - summary: Polars & Narwhals - Understanding Expressions When You're Used to pandas
    description: |
      When it comes to dataframes, pandas is the go-to library for
      many people. Yet Polars is taking the world by storm, and so
      many data practitioners are curious about trying it out. There
      is a learning curve though, as Polars introduces some concepts
      which pandas users might not be familiar with. This talk is a
      deep dive into one of those concepts (expressions) and will focus
      on how you can understand them from a pandas perspective.
